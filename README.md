# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Studies

This repository have my studies involving IA. In those jupyter notebooks I cover some content involving topic's like Machine Learning and DeepLearning.

## About Me

I am a dedicated and driven Machine Learning enthusiast with a strong foundation in both theory and practical application. I also have knowledge in fields of game development and web developing.

## Repository Highlights

- **Machine Learning:** Complete exercises training models from the data handling to the proper final model, using diferent models and approach in how to improve results.

- **Deep Learning:** Exercises involving the training of neural net's, using different combinations to better accuracy.

- **Data Cleaning:** Cases involving the data cleaning of not "training-ready" data.

## Contact

I am eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts, potential collaborators, and prospective employers who share a passion for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-grandini-novaes/?locale=en_US).

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and expertise to innovative projects that push the boundaries of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
